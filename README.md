# Phrase Hunter: Object-Oriented Programming Game

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming principles with Javascript through a browser-based, word guessing game called "Phrase Hunter". Players will try to guess a random hidden phrase by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard. 

Each time the player guesses a letter (only once), the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.

This project was created as part of the [Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/full-stack-javascript).
